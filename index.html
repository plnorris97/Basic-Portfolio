            <p>
                I am an experienced marketing professional with nearly 20 years of experience managing multi-channel campaigns for large financial and insurance corporations. As a member of fast-paced internal marketing teams, I excel at managing the many aspects of projects for my clients - utilizing various marketing and media channels - both tactical and strategic.
            </p>

            <p>
                Clients and vendors I have worked with to date include (but are not limited to) Edward Jones Investments (St. Louis, MO), Keller Williams Realty (Austin, TX), National Association of Realtors (Chicago, IL), Kingsmill/Michelob Ultra Open (Williamsburg, VA), Richmond International Raceway (Richmond, VA)
            </p>
            <p>
                I am highly organized and possess strong project management skills from the traditional to working in Agile Scrum. As such, I am a Certified Scrum Product Owner&reg; as well as a Certified Scrum Master&reg;. While in a previous role, I managed the redesign, development and deployment of two B2B websites. During this time, I was fortunate enough to learn a lot about the backend as well as the front end. I look forward to continuing the journey and growing as a web developer.
